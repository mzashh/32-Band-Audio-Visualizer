*  For people using a Pro mini you will have to solder a wire to the AREF pin on the IC, refer to the following picture:

* Also the Pro mini has no 3.3v onboard, so you will have to use a voltage divider or a voltage regulator to generate it refer to the following picture:

# Software

* Required libraries

* Method 1: Compiling the Arduino sketch and flashing it to the microcontroller.

* Method 2(not recommended): Flashing the precompiled hex file with xLoader.
 
   This method is not recommended as, parameters like Audio Response can't be fine tuned.
